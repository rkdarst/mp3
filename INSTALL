Installing uses python's distutils, so it should look like a standard
interface.  If you are root, and you want to install for everyone, you
should be able to do a simple

    python setup.py install

If "python" doesn't point to python2.3 or later, you need to do
something like this:

    python2.3 setup.py install

If you don't want to install as root (which would be wise), you can do
something like this:

    python setup.py install --install-lib=~/sys/fakeroots/pymod --install-scripts ~/bin

But, the catch is that you have to have the install-lib dir in your
PYTHONPATH.  I do this via a entry in my .bashrc file:

    export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/home/richard/sys/fakeroots/pymod"


UPGRADING / REMOVING

You should be able to install over the old version.  There may be
extra files lying around, but nothing should break.  If you want to
clean up these old files, simply delete the "mp3" directory from the
python install-lib directory, and mp3_* (check this first!!!) from the
install-bin directory.
