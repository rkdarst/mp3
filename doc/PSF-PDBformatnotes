RCSB[1] specifies that the residue name field has three spaces, but 
some residues in PSFs I use take up four spaces, VMD[2] can handle four-
byte fields. 

residue name is supposed to be from columns 18-20.  Column 21 is in 
dispute.  However, column 21 is not reserved for anything else, 
according to [1].  

My solution:  I will have it read columns 18-21 and use them all.
Whitespace is stripped from the beginning and end, so this will not
affect correct PDBs.  When I write out PDBs, I will print four fields,
but it will be left-aligned so it will only use the disputed column if
what was read in originally had too-long resnames.  

... more complicated than I thought...
