    ! changed the field names in labels objects:
           atomid -> atomname
           junk -> unused  
        This makes it so that numbers are *num
                              names are   *name
    <label>.parsepsf() now strips whitespace from fields and preserves
      allignment of atomname field
    fixed some stuff with alignment of fields--
      parses psf's by column number, not whitespace-separated fields
      should fix problems with the "atomname" field.
      might need bug testing
    added the function.py module to hold various utility functions
    added tools for parsing PDB coordinates and labels:
      pdbcord.py  -- cordinates from PDBs
      label method for reading labels from PDBs.
      pdbsystem()  -- easy PDB parsing.          
    label.py -- method findatom()
    clean up/add documentation for labels.py
    added align.py -- alignment of proteins
    added "rmsd()" in function.py
    added "cordtransform()" in function.py

    

0.3  2004-10-5
    added some stuff for carlos to make it work in a program
      that doesn't follow the PDB's standard about allignment
      not being significant
    changed included scripts to be called mp3_catdcd, etc
    added scripts mp3_namdawk  - greps namd output
                  mp3_xstboxsize - prints data from xst
    added mp3.xstbox  -- interface to xst files
    added a xst-wrapping feature to mp3.minimage()


0.2 more docstrings
    atomslice.py for taking slices of DCDs by atoms.
    printing PDBs by atom slices is possible now.
    dummycord.py added as a demonstration of making transforms on cords.
    more demonstration scripts in tests/
